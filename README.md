# Pixels Art 

## About: 
This is the first project I developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS together, at the Web Development Fundamentals at Trybe course. 

The goal was to create an interactive pixel-art board, where users could select random-generated colors and - by clicking - paint blank squares with it. 

Users can also customize the size of the board, clean it all to start again and generate new random colors as they like. 

## Tools: 
- JavaScript ES+ 
- HTML5
- CSS3

### In works: 
I plan to update some parts of the design.
